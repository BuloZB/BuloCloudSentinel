     - Semgrep
     - Bandit
     - Dependency scanning
     - Secret scanning

3. **Configuration Review**
   - Environment configurations
   - Infrastructure as code
   - Container configurations
   - Security headers and settings

4. **Testing**
   - Authentication and authorization testing
   - Input validation testing
   - Error handling testing
   - API security testing

## Findings

Findings are categorized by severity:

- **Critical:** Immediate action required; could lead to system compromise or data breach
- **High:** Action required soon; significant security risk
- **Medium:** Should be addressed in the near term; moderate security risk
- **Low:** Should be addressed when possible; minor security risk
- **Informational:** Best practice recommendations; minimal security risk
