# Dock Stations Security Audit Report

## Executive Summary

This security audit report provides an assessment of the security posture of the Dock Stations feature in Bulo.CloudSentinel. The audit was conducted to identify potential security vulnerabilities and provide recommendations for improving the security of the feature.

The Dock Stations feature enables integration with various drone docking stations, allowing for automated charging, protection from weather, and extended operational capabilities. The feature is implemented as a microservice that follows the adapter pattern, providing a unified interface for controlling and monitoring different types of docking stations.

## Recommendations

Based on the findings of this security audit, the following recommendations are provided to improve the security of the Dock Stations feature:

### High Priority

1. **Remove hardcoded credentials** (AUTH-03):
   - Replace hardcoded credentials with environment variables or secrets management.
   - Use Kubernetes secrets or a secrets management solution like HashiCorp Vault.

2. **Enforce TLS for API communication** (DATA-03):
   - Configure the API server to use HTTPS.
   - Implement TLS termination at the ingress controller.
   - Use Let's Encrypt or another certificate authority to obtain TLS certificates.

3. **Disable anonymous access to MQTT broker** (NET-03):
   - Configure the MQTT broker to require authentication.
   - Use strong passwords for MQTT authentication.
   - Consider using client certificates for MQTT authentication.

4. **Implement dependency scanning** (DEP-02):
   - Use tools like OWASP Dependency-Check or Snyk to scan dependencies for vulnerabilities.
   - Integrate dependency scanning into the CI/CD pipeline.
   - Regularly review and address identified vulnerabilities.

5. **Update dependencies with known vulnerabilities** (DEP-03):
   - Identify dependencies with known vulnerabilities.
