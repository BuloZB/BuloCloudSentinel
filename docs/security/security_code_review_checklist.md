  - [ ] Ensure that random number generators are cryptographically secure

- [ ] **Password Storage**
  - [ ] Verify that passwords are hashed with a strong algorithm (Argon2id, bcrypt)
  - [ ] Check that password hashing includes a unique salt
  - [ ] Ensure that password complexity requirements are enforced

- [ ] **Sensitive Data Handling**
  - [ ] Verify that sensitive data is encrypted at rest
  - [ ] Check that sensitive data is transmitted securely
  - [ ] Ensure that sensitive data is not logged or exposed in error messages

## Error Handling and Logging

- [ ] **Error Handling**
  - [ ] Verify that errors are handled gracefully
  - [ ] Check that error messages don't reveal sensitive information
  - [ ] Ensure that error handling doesn't introduce security vulnerabilities

- [ ] **Logging**
  - [ ] Verify that security-relevant events are logged
  - [ ] Check that logs don't contain sensitive information
  - [ ] Ensure that log data is protected from unauthorized access

## Session Management

- [ ] **Session Handling**
  - [ ] Verify that session identifiers are generated securely
  - [ ] Check that session data is stored securely
  - [ ] Ensure that sessions expire after appropriate timeouts
  - [ ] Verify that sessions can be invalidated on logout

- [ ] **Cookie Security**
  - [ ] Verify that cookies have appropriate security attributes (Secure, HttpOnly, SameSite)
  - [ ] Check that sensitive data is not stored in cookies
  - [ ] Ensure that cookie expiration is appropriate

## API Security

- [ ] **API Design**
  - [ ] Verify that APIs follow RESTful principles
  - [ ] Check that API endpoints are properly documented
  - [ ] Ensure that API versioning is implemented

- [ ] **API Protection**
  - [ ] Verify that APIs are protected against rate limiting
  - [ ] Check that APIs validate content types
  - [ ] Ensure that APIs implement proper authentication and authorization

## File Handling

- [ ] **File Uploads**
  - [ ] Verify that file uploads are validated for type, size, and content
  - [ ] Check that uploaded files are stored outside the web root
  - [ ] Ensure that file names are sanitized
  - [ ] Verify that uploaded files are scanned for malware

- [ ] **File Downloads**
  - [ ] Verify that file downloads are protected against path traversal
  - [ ] Check that file downloads include appropriate Content-Type headers
  - [ ] Ensure that file downloads are authorized

## Dependency Management

- [ ] **Third-Party Dependencies**
  - [ ] Verify that dependencies are from trusted sources
  - [ ] Check that dependencies are pinned to specific versions
  - [ ] Ensure that dependencies are regularly updated
  - [ ] Verify that dependencies are scanned for vulnerabilities

## Configuration and Environment

- [ ] **Configuration Management**
  - [ ] Verify that sensitive configuration is stored securely
  - [ ] Check that configuration is environment-specific
  - [ ] Ensure that default configurations are secure

- [ ] **Environment Security**
  - [ ] Verify that development/test data doesn't contain sensitive information
  - [ ] Check that debug features are disabled in production
  - [ ] Ensure that error reporting is configured appropriately for each environment

## Security Headers and CORS

- [ ] **Security Headers**
  - [ ] Verify that appropriate security headers are set:
    - [ ] Content-Security-Policy
    - [ ] X-Content-Type-Options
    - [ ] X-Frame-Options
    - [ ] Strict-Transport-Security
    - [ ] Referrer-Policy

- [ ] **CORS Configuration**
