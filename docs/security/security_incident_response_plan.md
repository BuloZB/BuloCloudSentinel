# Security Incident Response Plan

This document outlines the process for responding to security incidents in the Bulo.Cloud Sentinel project.

## Incident Response Team

The Incident Response Team (IRT) consists of:

- **Security Lead**: Responsible for overall coordination of the incident response
- **Technical Lead**: Responsible for technical investigation and remediation
- **Communications Lead**: Responsible for internal and external communications
- **Legal Advisor**: Provides legal guidance during the incident
- **Executive Sponsor**: Provides executive oversight and decision-making authority

## Incident Severity Levels

Security incidents are classified into the following severity levels:

### Critical (Level 1)

- Unauthorized access to production systems
- Exposure of sensitive customer data
- Compromise of authentication systems
- Widespread service disruption due to security issues

### High (Level 2)

- Potential unauthorized access to production systems
- Limited exposure of sensitive data
- Exploitation of a vulnerability in a non-critical system
- Targeted denial of service attack

### Medium (Level 3)

- Vulnerability discovered but not exploited
- Attempted unauthorized access (blocked by controls)
- Security misconfiguration with limited impact
- Isolated security policy violation

### Low (Level 4)

- Minor security policy violation
- Security event with no impact
- Suspicious activity that requires investigation
- Security improvement opportunity

## Incident Response Process

### 1. Preparation

- Maintain up-to-date contact information for the IRT
- Ensure access to necessary tools and resources
- Conduct regular incident response training and exercises
- Document system architecture and dependencies

### 2. Detection and Reporting

- Monitor security logs, alerts, and notifications
- Establish clear channels for reporting security incidents
- Document initial information about the incident
- Assign an initial severity level

#### Reporting Channels

- Email: security@bulo.cloud
- Security Slack channel: #security-incidents
- Phone: Emergency contact list (see internal documentation)

#### Initial Information to Collect

- Date and time of detection
- How the incident was detected
- Systems and data potentially affected
- Initial assessment of impact
- Actions already taken

### 3. Assessment and Triage

- Assemble the appropriate IRT members based on severity
- Confirm the incident and refine severity assessment
- Establish an incident-specific communication channel
- Create an incident ticket to track progress
- Determine if the incident response plan should be activated

### 4. Containment

#### Immediate Containment

- Isolate affected systems
- Block malicious IP addresses or users
- Revoke compromised credentials
- Disable vulnerable services

#### Short-term Containment

- Apply emergency patches or configurations
- Implement additional monitoring
- Preserve evidence for investigation
- Document all containment actions

### 5. Investigation

- Determine the root cause of the incident
- Identify the attack vector and exploitation method
- Assess the scope and impact of the incident
- Collect and preserve evidence
- Document the timeline of events

#### Evidence Collection

- System logs
- Network traffic captures
- Memory dumps
- Disk images
- User activity logs

### 6. Eradication

- Remove malware or unauthorized access mechanisms
- Patch vulnerabilities that were exploited
- Reset compromised credentials
- Harden systems against similar attacks
- Verify that all malicious components have been removed

### 7. Recovery

- Restore systems from clean backups if necessary
- Implement additional security controls
- Perform security testing before returning systems to production
- Monitor systems closely for any signs of persistent access
- Gradually restore services based on priority

### 8. Post-Incident Activities

#### Lessons Learned

- Conduct a post-incident review meeting
- Document what worked well and what could be improved
- Update the incident response plan based on lessons learned
- Identify root causes and contributing factors

#### Reporting

- Prepare an incident report documenting:
  - Incident timeline
  - Actions taken
  - Impact assessment
  - Root cause analysis
  - Recommendations for prevention

#### Follow-up Actions

- Implement recommended security improvements
- Update security policies and procedures
- Conduct additional training if necessary
- Share relevant information with the security community

## Communication Guidelines

### Internal Communication

- Use secure, dedicated channels for incident-related communications
- Provide regular updates to stakeholders
- Document all communications
- Maintain confidentiality of incident details

### External Communication

- All external communications must be approved by the Communications Lead
- Coordinate with Legal Advisor on disclosure requirements
- Provide clear, accurate information about the incident
- Focus on actions being taken to address the issue

## Legal and Compliance Considerations

- Determine if the incident triggers any regulatory reporting requirements
- Consult with Legal Advisor on disclosure obligations
- Document actions taken to comply with legal requirements
- Preserve evidence in a legally defensible manner

## Recovery and Remediation

- Develop a remediation plan to address root causes
- Implement additional security controls
- Update security monitoring capabilities
- Conduct follow-up security assessments
- Document lessons learned and improvements made

## Incident Response Drills

- Conduct regular incident response drills
- Test the effectiveness of the incident response plan
- Identify areas for improvement
- Update the plan based on drill results
