## Security Principles

### Defense in Depth

Defense in Depth is a security strategy that employs multiple layers of security controls throughout the system. The idea is that if one security control fails, others will still provide protection.

**Example in Bulo.Cloud Sentinel:**
- Input validation at the API layer
- Parameterized queries for database access
- Role-based access control for authorization
- Data encryption for sensitive information
- Secure logging for audit trails

### Principle of Least Privilege

The Principle of Least Privilege states that users and processes should have only the minimum privileges necessary to perform their functions.

**Example in Bulo.Cloud Sentinel:**
- Role-based access control with fine-grained permissions
- Service accounts with limited privileges
- Containerization to isolate components
- API keys with limited scope

### Secure by Default

Systems should be secure in their default configuration, requiring explicit action to reduce security rather than to enable it.

**Example in Bulo.Cloud Sentinel:**
- HTTPS enabled by default
- Secure cookie settings (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite=strict)
- Content Security Policy headers enabled
- Rate limiting enabled for all endpoints

### Fail Securely

When a system fails, it should fail in a way that maintains security rather than exposing vulnerabilities.

**Example in Bulo.Cloud Sentinel:**
- Default deny for authorization checks
- Proper error handling that doesn't expose sensitive information
- Timeouts for authentication tokens
- Graceful degradation of services

### Keep It Simple

Complex systems are harder to secure. Simplicity in design and implementation makes security easier to achieve and maintain.

**Example in Bulo.Cloud Sentinel:**
- Modular architecture with clear boundaries
- Consistent security patterns across the codebase
- Well-documented security controls
- Use of established libraries and frameworks

## Threat Modeling

Threat modeling is a structured approach to identifying, quantifying, and addressing security risks. It helps you understand how an attacker might compromise your system and what you can do to prevent it.

### STRIDE Threat Model

STRIDE is a threat modeling framework that categorizes threats into six types:

1. **Spoofing**: Impersonating something or someone else
   - Example: An attacker impersonates a legitimate user by stealing their credentials
   - Mitigation: Strong authentication, multi-factor authentication

2. **Tampering**: Modifying data or code
   - Example: An attacker modifies data in transit or at rest
   - Mitigation: Data integrity checks, digital signatures, TLS

3. **Repudiation**: Denying having performed an action
   - Example: A user denies having performed a sensitive operation
   - Mitigation: Secure logging, audit trails, digital signatures

4. **Information Disclosure**: Exposing information to unauthorized individuals
   - Example: Sensitive data is leaked through error messages or insecure storage
   - Mitigation: Data encryption, proper error handling, access controls

5. **Denial of Service**: Making a system or application unavailable
   - Example: Overwhelming a system with requests to make it unavailable
   - Mitigation: Rate limiting, resource quotas, scalable architecture

6. **Elevation of Privilege**: Gaining capabilities without proper authorization
   - Example: A regular user gains administrative privileges
   - Mitigation: Principle of least privilege, proper authorization checks

### Threat Modeling Process

1. **Identify Assets**: What are you trying to protect?
   - User data
   - System functionality
   - Intellectual property
   - Reputation

2. **Create a System Model**: How does your system work?
   - Data flow diagrams
   - System architecture
   - Trust boundaries

3. **Identify Threats**: What could go wrong?
   - Use STRIDE or other frameworks
   - Consider both technical and non-technical threats

4. **Mitigate Risks**: How can you address the threats?
   - Implement security controls
   - Change system design if necessary
   - Accept, transfer, or avoid risks that cannot be mitigated

5. **Validate**: Did your mitigations work?
   - Security testing
   - Code review
   - Penetration testing

## Security Controls

Security controls are safeguards or countermeasures to avoid, detect, counteract, or minimize security risks. They can be categorized as preventive, detective, or corrective.

### Preventive Controls

Preventive controls aim to stop an attack before it happens.

**Examples in Bulo.Cloud Sentinel:**
- Input validation
- Authentication and authorization
- Encryption
- Secure configuration
- Firewall rules

### Detective Controls

Detective controls aim to identify when an attack is occurring or has occurred.

**Examples in Bulo.Cloud Sentinel:**
- Logging and monitoring
- Intrusion detection systems
- Security scanning
- Anomaly detection
- Audit trails

### Corrective Controls

Corrective controls aim to reduce the impact of an attack after it has occurred.

**Examples in Bulo.Cloud Sentinel:**
- Incident response procedures
- Backup and recovery
- Patch management
- Vulnerability management
- Business continuity planning

## Authentication and Authorization

Authentication and authorization are fundamental security concepts that control access to resources.

### Authentication

Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or system.

**Authentication Methods in Bulo.Cloud Sentinel:**
- Password-based authentication with Argon2id hashing
- JWT tokens for API authentication
- Multi-factor authentication for sensitive operations
- OAuth2 for third-party authentication

### Authorization

Authorization is the process of determining what actions an authenticated user or system is allowed to perform.

**Authorization Methods in Bulo.Cloud Sentinel:**
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Attribute-based access control (ABAC)
- Permission checks at the API and service layers
- Token-based authorization with scopes

### Session Management

Session management is the process of maintaining state between a user and the system.

**Session Management in Bulo.Cloud Sentinel:**
- JWT tokens with appropriate expiration
- Secure cookie settings (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite=strict)
- Token revocation for logout
- Session timeout for inactive users

## Data Protection

Data protection involves safeguarding data throughout its lifecycle, from creation to deletion.

### Data Classification

Data should be classified based on its sensitivity and importance.

**Data Classification in Bulo.Cloud Sentinel:**
- Public: Information that can be freely disclosed
- Internal: Information for internal use only
- Confidential: Sensitive information that requires protection
- Restricted: Highly sensitive information with strict access controls

### Data Encryption

Encryption protects data confidentiality by converting it into a form that can only be read with the proper key.

**Encryption in Bulo.Cloud Sentinel:**
- Transport Layer Security (TLS) for data in transit
- AES-256 for data at rest
- Key management for encryption keys
- End-to-end encryption for sensitive communications

### Data Integrity

Data integrity ensures that data has not been altered in an unauthorized manner.

**Data Integrity in Bulo.Cloud Sentinel:**
- Digital signatures for critical data
- Hash-based integrity checks
- Audit trails for data modifications
- Version control for configuration and code

### Data Privacy

Data privacy involves protecting personal information and complying with privacy regulations.

**Data Privacy in Bulo.Cloud Sentinel:**
- Privacy by design principles
- Data minimization
- Purpose limitation
- User consent management
- Data retention policies

## Secure Communications

Secure communications involve protecting data as it travels between systems.

### Transport Layer Security (TLS)

TLS provides encryption, authentication, and integrity for data in transit.

**TLS in Bulo.Cloud Sentinel:**
- TLS 1.2+ for all communications
- Strong cipher suites
- Certificate validation
- Perfect forward secrecy

### API Security

APIs should be secured to prevent unauthorized access and data leakage.

**API Security in Bulo.Cloud Sentinel:**
- Authentication for all API endpoints
- Authorization checks for sensitive operations
- Input validation for all parameters
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Proper error handling

### Secure WebSockets

WebSockets should be secured to protect real-time communications.

**WebSocket Security in Bulo.Cloud Sentinel:**
- WSS (WebSocket Secure) protocol
- Authentication for WebSocket connections
- Message validation
- Rate limiting for WebSocket messages
