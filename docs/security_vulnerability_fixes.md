Alternatively, you can update your existing requirements.txt file with the versions listed above.

## Additional Security Improvements

In addition to updating vulnerable dependencies, the following security improvements have been implemented:

### 1. Enhanced JWT Token Validation

- Implemented full signature verification for JWT tokens
- Added expiration time validation
- Added issued-at time validation to prevent token reuse
- Added clock skew protection (30 seconds) to handle minor time differences
- Added proper error logging for token validation failures
- Implemented token revocation and blacklisting for secure logout
- Added Redis-backed persistent token blacklist with fallback to in-memory storage

### 2. Secure Session Management

- Removed hardcoded session secrets
- Implemented secure random session key generation
- Set secure cookie attributes:
  - `SameSite=strict` to prevent CSRF attacks
  - `HttpOnly=true` to prevent JavaScript access
  - `Secure=true` to ensure cookies are only sent over HTTPS
  - Added session timeout (1 hour)
- Added centralized session configuration

### 3. CORS Protection

- Replaced wildcard CORS settings (`*`) with specific allowed origins
- Limited allowed HTTP methods to only those needed
- Restricted allowed headers to specific required headers
- Added header exposure controls
- Implemented preflight request caching (1 hour)
- Added environment variable configuration for CORS settings

### 4. Secure Password Handling

- Using Argon2id for password hashing (OWASP recommended)
- Implemented secure password policy enforcement
- Added password complexity requirements
- Implemented secure password generation utilities
- Added checks for common passwords and sequential characters
- Added validation to prevent using personal information in passwords
- Improved password hash verification with proper error handling

### 5. Code Security

- Removed hardcoded credentials and API keys
- Implemented environment variable-based configuration
- Added input validation and sanitization
- Improved error handling to prevent information leakage
- Centralized security configuration in a dedicated module

### 6. Security Headers

- Implemented Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
- Added HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) headers
- Added X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, and X-XSS-Protection headers
- Implemented Permissions Policy headers
- Added Cross-Origin headers (Opener, Embedder, Resource)
- Created a comprehensive SecurityHeadersMiddleware

### 7. Rate Limiting

- Implemented advanced rate limiting for all API endpoints
- Added specific rate limits for authentication endpoints
- Implemented different rate limits for authenticated vs. unauthenticated users
- Added proper rate limit headers (X-RateLimit-Limit, X-RateLimit-Remaining, X-RateLimit-Reset)
- Implemented memory-efficient rate limiting with automatic cleanup

### 8. Secure File Uploads

- Implemented secure file upload validation
- Added content type verification using python-magic
- Implemented file size limits
- Added extension validation and filtering
- Implemented protection against path traversal attacks
- Added sanitization of filenames
- Implemented file hash computation for integrity verification

## Additional Security Recommendations

1. Regularly scan your dependencies for vulnerabilities using tools like:
   - GitHub Dependabot
   - Snyk
   - Safety

2. Set up automated dependency scanning in your CI/CD pipeline

3. Subscribe to security advisories for critical dependencies

4. Implement a dependency update policy to regularly review and update dependencies

5. Conduct regular security audits of the codebase

6. Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers

7. Add rate limiting for authentication endpoints

8. Implement proper token revocation and blacklisting

9. Use parameterized queries for all database operations
