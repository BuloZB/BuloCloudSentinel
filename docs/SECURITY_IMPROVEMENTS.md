# Security Improvements

This document outlines the security improvements made to the Bulo.Cloud Sentinel codebase.

## 1. Dependency Security

### Fixed Vulnerabilities

- **hvac**: Updated from 1.2.1 to 2.3.0 to fix:
  - CVE-2024-34069: Security issue in Werkzeug dependency
  - CVE-2024-37568: Security issue in Authlib dependency

### Pinned Dependencies

Pinned previously unpinned dependencies in SentinelWeb to secure versions:
- anthropic==0.23.0
- redis==5.0.3
- pymongo==4.7.1
- openai==1.30.0
- tiktoken==0.6.0
- async-timeout==4.0.3
- aiocache==0.12.2
- aiofiles==23.2.1

## 2. Cryptographic Security

### Secure Random Number Generation

Replaced standard `random` module with cryptographically secure alternatives:

- **FHSS Module**:
  - Replaced `random.Random()` with HMAC-SHA256 based secure deterministic randomness
  - Implemented Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm with secure randomness
  - Replaced `random.randint()` with `secrets.token_bytes()` for sequence numbers

## 3. API Security

### Security Headers

- Implemented consistent security headers across all services:
  - Content Security Policy (CSP)
  - X-Content-Type-Options
  - X-Frame-Options
  - X-XSS-Protection
  - Strict-Transport-Security
  - Referrer-Policy
  - Permissions-Policy

### Rate Limiting

- Added configurable rate limiting to protect against abuse:
  - Configurable limits (requests per second/minute/hour/day)
  - Path-specific rate limiting for sensitive endpoints
  - Proper error responses for rate-limited requests

### Input Validation

- Created comprehensive input validation middleware:
  - Schema-based validation for all incoming requests
  - Protection against malformed JSON
  - Detailed error responses for validation failures

## 4. Authentication Enhancements

### Token Security

- Implemented token blacklisting for secure logout:
  - In-memory token blacklist with automatic cleanup
  - Validation against blacklist during token verification
  - Support for individual token revocation
  - Support for revoking all tokens for a user

### JWT Improvements

- Enhanced JWT token security:
  - Comprehensive token validation
  - Protection against token reuse
  - Proper error handling for invalid tokens

## 5. Configuration Security

### Environment Variables

- Removed hard-coded credentials from Docker Compose files:
  - Database credentials (PostgreSQL)
  - Object storage credentials (MinIO)
  - API tokens and secrets

- Added environment variable references with secure defaults:
  - `${POSTGRES_USER:-postgres}`
  - `${POSTGRES_PASSWORD:-postgres}`
  - `${MINIO_ACCESS_KEY:-minioadmin}`
  - `${MINIO_SECRET_KEY:-minioadmin}`

### Documentation

- Created `.env.example` files to document required environment variables
- Added comprehensive security documentation

## 6. Best Practices

- Use environment variables for all sensitive configuration
- Use secrets management for production deployments
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Use parameterized queries for database operations
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- Use secure password hashing with Argon2id
- Implement proper JWT validation and verification

## 7. Secrets Management

### Centralized Secrets Manager

- Implemented a comprehensive secrets management system:
  - Multiple backend support (Environment, HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)
  - Secure secret retrieval and storage
  - Fallback mechanisms for high availability

### Secret Rotation

- Added automatic secret rotation capabilities:
  - Configurable rotation intervals
  - Support for custom secret generators
  - Notification callbacks for rotation events

### Secrets API

- Created a secure API for managing secrets:
  - Role-based access control for secret management
  - Endpoints for retrieving, storing, and rotating secrets
  - Comprehensive logging of secret operations

## 8. Network Security

### Mutual TLS (mTLS)

- Implemented mutual TLS for service-to-service authentication:
  - Certificate-based authentication for services
  - Certificate validation and verification
  - Support for certificate fingerprinting and subject validation

### Network Segmentation

- Added network policy management:
  - Rule-based access control for service communication
  - Support for IP-based and service-based rules
  - Default deny with explicit allow policies

### TLS Enhancements

- Enhanced TLS configuration:
  - Modern cipher suites for strong encryption
  - Secure protocol versions (TLS 1.2+)
  - Certificate validation and verification

## 9. Security Monitoring

### Security Event Monitoring

- Implemented comprehensive security event monitoring:
  - Centralized event collection and processing
  - Configurable event severity levels
  - Support for various event types (authentication, authorization, etc.)
  - Extensible handler architecture

### Security Alerting

- Added security alerting capabilities:
  - Alert generation based on security events
  - Alert lifecycle management (acknowledgment, resolution, etc.)
  - Support for email and webhook notifications
  - Comprehensive alert history

### Monitoring API

- Created a secure API for security monitoring:
  - Endpoints for event creation and querying
  - Alert management and assignment
  - Webhook configuration for external integrations
  - Role-based access control for monitoring functions

## 10. Automated Security Testing

### Security Scanning

- Implemented automated security scanning:
  - Integration with multiple security scanners (Bandit, Safety, Semgrep)
  - Comprehensive vulnerability detection
  - Detailed issue reporting with severity classification
  - Support for various scan targets (files, directories, dependencies)

### Testing API

- Created a secure API for security testing:
  - Endpoints for initiating security scans
  - Background scan execution
  - Result retrieval and filtering
  - Scan result persistence

## 11. Recommendations for Further Improvements

1. **Container Security**:
   - Implement container image scanning
   - Use minimal base images
   - Apply principle of least privilege to containers

2. **Compliance Monitoring**:
   - Implement compliance frameworks (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.)
   - Automated compliance reporting
   - Compliance violation detection and alerting

3. **Threat Intelligence Integration**:
   - Integrate with threat intelligence feeds
   - Automated threat detection
   - Proactive security measures
