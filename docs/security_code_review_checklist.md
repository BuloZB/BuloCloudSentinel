# Security Code Review Checklist

This checklist provides a comprehensive set of security considerations for code reviews in the Bulo.Cloud Sentinel project. Use this checklist to ensure that code changes maintain or improve the security posture of the application.

## Authentication and Authorization

### Authentication
- [ ] All authentication code uses the unified_auth.py module
- [ ] No direct use of python-jose (use PyJWT instead)
- [ ] Password hashing uses Argon2id (via unified_auth.py)
- [ ] JWT tokens include proper claims (sub, exp, iat, jti, type)
- [ ] JWT tokens are validated with all required checks
- [ ] Token expiration times are reasonable
- [ ] No sensitive data is stored in tokens
- [ ] Authentication failures are logged securely

### Authorization
- [ ] All endpoints have appropriate authorization checks
- [ ] Role-based access control is implemented correctly
- [ ] Permission checks are applied consistently
- [ ] Principle of least privilege is followed
- [ ] Authorization failures are logged securely
- [ ] No authorization bypasses are possible

## Input Validation and Output Encoding

### Input Validation
- [ ] All user inputs are validated
- [ ] Validation is performed on the server side
- [ ] Input validation uses appropriate methods (e.g., Pydantic models)
- [ ] Validation errors are handled gracefully
- [ ] No raw SQL queries with user inputs (use ORM or parameterized queries)
- [ ] File uploads are validated for type, size, and content

### Output Encoding
- [ ] All outputs are properly encoded for their context
- [ ] HTML outputs use proper escaping
- [ ] JSON outputs are properly serialized
- [ ] No sensitive data is leaked in outputs
- [ ] Error messages don't reveal sensitive information

## Secure Data Handling

### Data Protection
- [ ] Sensitive data is encrypted at rest
- [ ] Encryption uses strong algorithms and keys
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets or credentials
- [ ] Secrets are stored securely (e.g., environment variables)
- [ ] Data is minimized (only necessary data is collected)
- [ ] Data retention policies are followed

### Session Management
- [ ] Sessions are managed securely
- [ ] Session IDs are generated securely
- [ ] Sessions have appropriate timeouts
- [ ] Sessions can be revoked
- [ ] Session data is protected

## Secure Communications

### TLS/SSL
- [ ] All communications use TLS/SSL
- [ ] TLS configuration is secure (modern protocols and ciphers)
- [ ] Certificate validation is performed correctly
- [ ] No mixed content (HTTP and HTTPS)
- [ ] Secure HTTP headers are used (HSTS, CSP, etc.)

### API Security
- [ ] API endpoints are secured
- [ ] API authentication is implemented correctly
- [ ] API rate limiting is implemented
- [ ] API responses don't leak sensitive information
- [ ] API documentation doesn't reveal sensitive information

## Error Handling and Logging

### Error Handling
- [ ] Errors are handled gracefully
- [ ] Error messages don't reveal sensitive information
- [ ] Exceptions are caught and handled appropriately
- [ ] No stack traces in production
- [ ] Error handling doesn't introduce security vulnerabilities

### Logging
- [ ] Security events are logged
- [ ] Logs don't contain sensitive information
- [ ] Log levels are appropriate
- [ ] Logs are protected from tampering
- [ ] Logs are retained for an appropriate period

## Dependency Management

### Dependencies
- [ ] Dependencies are up to date
- [ ] No vulnerable dependencies
- [ ] Dependencies are from trusted sources
- [ ] Dependency versions are pinned
- [ ] Unnecessary dependencies are removed

### Third-Party Code
- [ ] Third-party code is reviewed for security
- [ ] Third-party code is from trusted sources
- [ ] Third-party code is kept up to date
- [ ] Third-party code is minimized

## Secure Coding Practices

### General
- [ ] Code follows secure coding guidelines
- [ ] No commented-out code with sensitive information
- [ ] No debugging code in production
- [ ] No hardcoded credentials or secrets
- [ ] No unnecessary functionality

### Language-Specific
- [ ] Python: No use of eval(), exec(), or similar functions
- [ ] Python: No use of pickle with untrusted data
- [ ] Python: No use of os.system() or subprocess with user inputs
- [ ] JavaScript: No use of eval(), Function(), or similar functions
- [ ] JavaScript: No use of innerHTML with user inputs
- [ ] SQL: No raw SQL queries with user inputs

## Security Testing

### Testing
- [ ] Security tests are included
- [ ] Tests cover security-critical functionality
- [ ] Tests include negative cases (invalid inputs, unauthorized access)
- [ ] Tests don't contain sensitive information
- [ ] Tests are automated

### Scanning
- [ ] Code passes static analysis (bandit, semgrep)
- [ ] No secrets in code (detect-secrets)
- [ ] No vulnerable dependencies (safety)
- [ ] No security issues in containers (trivy)
- [ ] No security issues in infrastructure code

## JWT Token Handling Specific Checks

### Token Creation
- [ ] Tokens are created using unified_auth.create_access_token()
- [ ] Tokens include appropriate claims (sub, exp, iat, jti, type)
- [ ] Token expiration times are reasonable
- [ ] No sensitive data is stored in tokens
- [ ] Refresh tokens are handled securely

### Token Validation
- [ ] Tokens are validated using unified_auth.decode_token()
- [ ] All required claims are validated
- [ ] Token signature is verified
- [ ] Token expiration is checked
- [ ] Token type is checked
- [ ] Token blacklist is checked

### Token Revocation
- [ ] Tokens can be revoked (added to blacklist)
- [ ] Token blacklist is checked during validation
- [ ] Tokens are revoked on logout
- [ ] Tokens are revoked on password change
- [ ] User tokens can be revoked in bulk

## Example: JWT Token Handling Review

When reviewing code that handles JWT tokens, ensure it follows these patterns:

### Good Example (Using unified_auth.py)

```python
from security.auth.unified_auth import create_access_token, decode_token

# Creating a token
token = create_access_token(
    subject=user.id,
    roles=user.roles,
    permissions=user.permissions
)

# Validating a token
try:
    token_data = decode_token(token)
    user_id = token_data.sub
except HTTPException as e:
    # Handle invalid token
    pass
```

### Bad Example (Not Using unified_auth.py)

```python
import jwt

# Creating a token - DON'T DO THIS
token = jwt.encode(
    {"user_id": user.id},
    "secret",
    algorithm="HS256"
)

# Validating a token - DON'T DO THIS
try:
    payload = jwt.decode(token, "secret", algorithms=["HS256"])
    user_id = payload["user_id"]
except jwt.InvalidTokenError:
    # Handle invalid token
    pass
```

## Conclusion

This checklist is not exhaustive but provides a good starting point for security-focused code reviews. Always consider the specific security requirements of the Bulo.Cloud Sentinel project and update this checklist as needed.

Remember that security is a continuous process, and code reviews are just one part of a comprehensive security program. Regular security testing, monitoring, and education are also essential.
