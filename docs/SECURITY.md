## Authentication and Authorization

### JWT Authentication

Bulo.Cloud Sentinel uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication with the following security features:

- Short-lived access tokens (default: 30 minutes)
- Refresh token rotation
- Secure token storage
- Token validation with proper signature verification
- Token revocation capabilities

### Password Security

- Passwords are hashed using Argon2id (memory-hard hashing algorithm)
- Password complexity requirements enforced
- Password rotation policies
- Brute force protection with rate limiting

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

- Fine-grained permission system
- Principle of least privilege
- Role hierarchy
- Permission inheritance

## Data Protection

### Encryption

- Data at rest encryption using AES-256
- Data in transit encryption using TLS 1.3
- Key management with proper key rotation
- Hybrid encryption (RSA + AES) for sensitive data

### Secure Data Handling

- Sensitive data masking in logs
- Secure data deletion
- Data minimization principles
- Input validation and sanitization

## API Security

### Input Validation

- Strict schema validation using Pydantic
- Input sanitization to prevent injection attacks
- Content type validation
- Size limits on requests

### Rate Limiting

- Per-endpoint rate limiting
- Per-user rate limiting
- IP-based rate limiting
- Graduated rate limiting with increasing delays

### CORS Protection

- Strict CORS policy
- Allowed origins configuration
- Credentials handling
- Preflight request handling

### CSRF Protection

- Double Submit Cookie pattern
- SameSite cookie attributes
- CSRF tokens for state-changing operations
- Automatic CSRF protection middleware

## Network Security

### TLS Configuration

- TLS 1.3 with secure cipher suites
- Perfect Forward Secrecy
- OCSP stapling
- Certificate validation
- HSTS implementation

### Security Headers

- Content-Security-Policy (CSP)
- X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- X-Frame-Options: DENY
- Strict-Transport-Security
- Referrer-Policy
- Permissions-Policy

## Secure Coding Practices

### Injection Prevention

- SQL Injection protection
- NoSQL Injection protection
- Command Injection protection
- XSS protection
- Path Traversal protection

### Error Handling

- Secure error handling
- Custom error pages
- No sensitive information in error messages
- Centralized error logging

### Dependency Management

- Regular dependency updates
- Vulnerability scanning
- Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)
- Dependency pinning

## Security Monitoring

### Audit Logging

- Comprehensive audit logging
- Secure log storage
- Log integrity protection
- Log analysis capabilities

### Security Alerts

- Real-time security alerts
- Anomaly detection
- Brute force detection
- Suspicious activity monitoring

## Security Configuration

### Environment-Based Configuration

- Secure default settings
- Environment-specific configurations
- No hardcoded credentials
- Secret management

### Secure Deployment

- Container security
- Least privilege principle
- Network segmentation
- Regular security updates

## Security Testing

### Automated Security Testing

- Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
- Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Regular penetration testing

### Security CI/CD

- Security checks in CI/CD pipeline
- Automated vulnerability scanning
- Security regression testing
- Security metrics and reporting

## Security Recommendations for Deployment

1. **Use Environment Variables for Secrets**
   - Never hardcode credentials in configuration files
   - Use a secure secret management solution (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)
   - Rotate secrets regularly

2. **Configure CORS Properly**
   - Set specific allowed origins instead of wildcard (`*`)
   - Only allow necessary HTTP methods
   - Only allow necessary HTTP headers

3. **Enable TLS**
   - Use TLS 1.3 with secure cipher suites
   - Configure proper certificate validation
   - Enable HSTS with proper settings

4. **Set Up Rate Limiting**
   - Configure rate limiting based on your application's needs
   - Set different limits for different endpoints
   - Implement graduated rate limiting

5. **Configure Security Headers**
   - Set up Content-Security-Policy
   - Enable X-Frame-Options
   - Configure Referrer-Policy
   - Set up Permissions-Policy

6. **Implement Proper Logging**
   - Configure comprehensive audit logging
   - Set up log rotation
   - Ensure logs are stored securely
   - Implement log analysis

7. **Regular Security Updates**
   - Keep dependencies up to date
   - Apply security patches promptly
   - Monitor security advisories
   - Implement automated dependency updates

8. **Security Monitoring**
   - Set up real-time security monitoring
   - Configure alerts for suspicious activities
   - Implement anomaly detection
   - Regularly review security logs
