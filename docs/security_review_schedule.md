### Automated Security Scans

Automated security scans are performed regularly to identify security vulnerabilities in the codebase. These scans include:

1. **Dependency Scanning**: Scanning for vulnerable dependencies using Safety.
2. **Static Code Analysis**: Analyzing code for security issues using Bandit and Semgrep.
3. **Secret Detection**: Detecting secrets in code using Detect-Secrets.
4. **Container Scanning**: Scanning container images for vulnerabilities using Trivy.
5. **Dynamic Application Security Testing**: Testing the running application for vulnerabilities using OWASP ZAP.

### Manual Security Reviews

Manual security reviews are performed by security experts to identify security vulnerabilities that automated tools may miss. These reviews include:

1. **Code Reviews**: Reviewing code for security issues using the [Security Code Review Checklist](security_code_review_checklist.md).
2. **Architecture Reviews**: Reviewing the architecture for security issues.
3. **Configuration Reviews**: Reviewing configurations for security issues.
4. **Threat Modeling**: Identifying potential threats and vulnerabilities.
