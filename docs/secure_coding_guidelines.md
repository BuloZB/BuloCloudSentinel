## General Security Principles

### Defense in Depth

- Implement multiple layers of security controls throughout the application
- Never rely on a single security control to protect sensitive functionality
- Assume that any single security control can be bypassed

### Least Privilege

- Grant the minimum privileges necessary for each component to function
- Use role-based access control (RBAC) for all user operations
- Run services with the minimum required permissions

### Secure by Default

- All security features should be enabled by default
- Require explicit opt-out for disabling security features
- Default configurations should be the most secure options

### Fail Securely

- When a security control fails, it should fail in a secure state
- Default to denying access when authentication or authorization fails
- Handle errors in a way that doesn't expose sensitive information

### Keep It Simple

- Complex systems are harder to secure
- Minimize the attack surface by removing unnecessary features and code
- Use well-tested libraries and frameworks rather than custom implementations

## Authentication and Authorization

### Password Handling

- Use the `security.auth.password` module for all password operations
- Never store passwords in plaintext or using weak hashing algorithms
- Use Argon2id for password hashing with appropriate parameters
- Implement password complexity requirements:
  - Minimum length of 12 characters
  - Require a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
  - Check against common password lists
  - Prevent use of personal information in passwords

### Token Management

- Use the `security.auth.jwt_handler` module for all JWT operations
- Implement proper token validation with signature verification
- Set appropriate token expiration times (30 minutes for access tokens)
- Implement token revocation using the token blacklist
- Use secure cookie settings for storing tokens:
  - `HttpOnly` to prevent JavaScript access
  - `Secure` to ensure HTTPS-only transmission
  - `SameSite=strict` to prevent CSRF attacks

### Multi-Factor Authentication

- Implement MFA for all administrative and sensitive operations
- Use the `security.auth.mfa` module for MFA operations
- Support TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) using standard algorithms
- Provide backup codes for account recovery

### Session Management

- Implement secure session handling with proper timeout (1 hour maximum)

- Invalidate sessions on logout and password change
- Implement absolute and idle session timeouts

### Authorization
