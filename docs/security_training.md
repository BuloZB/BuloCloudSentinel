## Introduction

Security is a critical aspect of the Bulo.Cloud Sentinel platform. As a developer, you play a crucial role in ensuring the security of the platform. This training will help you understand secure coding practices, common vulnerabilities, and incident response procedures.

### Security Principles

The Bulo.Cloud Sentinel platform follows these security principles:

1. **Defense in Depth**: Implement multiple layers of security controls to protect the system.
2. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Grant the minimum level of access necessary for a user, process, or system to perform its function.
3. **Secure by Default**: Design systems to be secure by default, with secure configurations enabled out of the box.
4. **Fail Secure**: When a system fails, it should fail in a secure state rather than exposing sensitive information or functionality.
5. **Keep It Simple**: Simple designs are easier to understand, implement, and verify for security issues.

## Secure Coding Practices

### Using the Security Module

The Bulo.Cloud Sentinel platform provides a comprehensive security module that you should use for all security-related functionality. The security module includes:

- **Authentication and Authorization**: Use the `security.auth` module for all authentication and authorization needs.
- **Input Validation**: Use the `security.validation` module for all input validation needs.
- **Error Handling**: Use the `security.error_handling` module for all error handling needs.
- **API Security**: Use the `security.api` module for all API security needs.
- **Logging**: Use the `security.logging` module for all logging needs.

### Authentication and Authorization

Always use the unified authentication module for all authentication needs:

```python
from security.auth.unified_auth import (
    hash_password,
    verify_password,
    create_access_token,
    get_current_user_id,
    require_role,
)

# Hash a password
hashed_password = hash_password("secure_password")

# Verify a password
is_valid = verify_password(hashed_password, "secure_password")

# Create a JWT token
token = create_access_token(
    subject="user_id",
    roles=["admin"],
    permissions=["read", "write"]
)

# Protect an endpoint with role-based access control
@app.get("/admin")
async def admin_endpoint(token_data = Depends(require_role("admin"))):
    return {"message": "Admin access granted"}
```

### Input Validation

Always use the unified validation module for all input validation needs:

```python
from security.validation.unified_validation import (
    validate_email,
    validate_username,
    sanitize_string,
    form_validator,
)

# Validate an email
is_valid = validate_email("user@example.com")

# Sanitize user input
safe_input = sanitize_string(user_input)

# Validate a form
validation_schema = {
    "username": {"type": "string", "min_length": 3, "max_length": 32},
    "email": {"type": "email", "required": True},
    "age": {"type": "integer", "min_value": 18, "max_value": 120},
}

try:
    validated_data = form_validator.validate_form(form_data, validation_schema)
except HTTPException as e:
    # Handle validation error
    pass
```

### Error Handling

Always use the unified error handling module for all error handling needs:

```python
from security.error_handling.secure_error_handler import (
    configure_error_handlers,
    create_error_response,
    AuthenticationException,
    ValidationException,
)

# Configure error handlers for the application
configure_error_handlers(app)

# Raise custom exceptions
@app.get("/protected")
async def protected_route():
    if not is_authenticated():
        raise AuthenticationException("Authentication required")
    
    # ...

# Create custom error responses
@app.exception_handler(CustomException)
async def handle_custom_exception(request: Request, exc: CustomException):
    return create_error_response(
        error_type="custom_error",
        message=str(exc),
        status_code=status.HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST
    )
```

### Secure Logging

Always use the secure logging module for all logging needs:

```python
from security.logging.secure_logging import get_secure_logger

logger = get_secure_logger("auth_service")

def login_user(username: str, password: str):
    logger.info(f"Login attempt for user: {username}")
    
    # Login logic
    # ...
    
    if success:
        logger.info(f"Login successful for user: {username}")
    else:
        logger.warning(f"Login failed for user: {username}")
```

## Common Vulnerabilities

### Injection Attacks

Injection attacks occur when untrusted data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or query. The attacker's hostile data can trick the interpreter into executing unintended commands or accessing data without proper authorization.

#### SQL Injection

SQL injection occurs when untrusted data is included in a SQL query without proper validation or sanitization.

```python
# Vulnerable code
username = request.form["username"]
query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '{username}'"
result = database.execute(query)

# Secure code
username = request.form["username"]
query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?"
result = database.execute(query, (username,))
```

#### Command Injection

Command injection occurs when untrusted data is included in a system command without proper validation or sanitization.

```python
# Vulnerable code
filename = request.form["filename"]
os.system(f"cat {filename}")

# Secure code
filename = request.form["filename"]
if not validate_filename(filename):
    raise ValidationException("Invalid filename")
subprocess.run(["cat", filename], check=True)
```

### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

Cross-site scripting (XSS) occurs when untrusted data is included in a web page without proper validation or sanitization, allowing attackers to execute malicious scripts in the victim's browser.

```python
# Vulnerable code
@app.route("/profile")
def profile():
    username = request.args.get("username")
    return f"<h1>Profile for {username}</h1>"

# Secure code
@app.route("/profile")
def profile():
    username = request.args.get("username")
    return f"<h1>Profile for {html.escape(username)}</h1>"
```

### Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) occurs when an attacker tricks a victim into performing an action on a web application in which the victim is authenticated.

```python
# Vulnerable code
@app.route("/transfer", methods=["POST"])
def transfer():
    amount = request.form["amount"]
    to_account = request.form["to_account"]
    # Transfer logic
    # ...

# Secure code
from security.api.csrf_protection import csrf_protect

@app.route("/transfer", methods=["POST"])
@csrf_protect
def transfer():
    amount = request.form["amount"]
    to_account = request.form["to_account"]
    # Transfer logic
    # ...
```

### Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)

Insecure direct object references (IDOR) occur when an application exposes a reference to an internal implementation object, such as a file, directory, database record, or key, without proper access control checks.

```python
# Vulnerable code
@app.route("/documents/<document_id>")
def get_document(document_id):
    document = Document.get(document_id)
    return document.content

# Secure code
@app.route("/documents/<document_id>")
def get_document(document_id):
    document = Document.get(document_id)
    if document.user_id != current_user.id and not current_user.is_admin:
        raise AuthorizationException("You don't have permission to access this document")
    return document.content
```

### Security Misconfiguration

Security misconfiguration occurs when security settings are not properly configured, leaving the application vulnerable to attacks.

```python
# Vulnerable code
app = FastAPI(
    title="Bulo.Cloud Sentinel",
    description="Secure drone surveillance platform",
    version="1.0.0",
    docs_url="/docs",  # Expose docs in production
    redoc_url="/redoc",  # Expose redoc in production
)

# Secure code
app = FastAPI(
    title="Bulo.Cloud Sentinel",
    description="Secure drone surveillance platform",
    version="1.0.0",
    docs_url=None if os.getenv("ENVIRONMENT") == "production" else "/docs",
    redoc_url=None if os.getenv("ENVIRONMENT") == "production" else "/redoc",
)

# Configure security middleware with secure defaults
configure_security(app)
```

## Security Testing

### Using the Security Test Runner

The Bulo.Cloud Sentinel platform provides a comprehensive security test runner that you can use to identify security vulnerabilities in the codebase:

```python
from security.testing.security_test_runner import SecurityTestRunner

# Create a security test runner
runner = SecurityTestRunner(
    target_url="http://localhost:8000",
    reports_dir=Path("reports/security"),
    verbose=True
)

# Run all security tests
results = runner.run_all_tests()

# Generate a report
report_file = runner.generate_report()
```

### Running Security Tests

You can also run security tests from the command line:

```bash
# Run all security tests
python security/testing/security_test_runner.py --target http://localhost:8000 --output markdown --verbose

# Run specific security tests
python security/testing/security_test_runner.py --target http://localhost:8000 --tests dependency,bandit,api --output markdown --verbose
```

### Interpreting Security Test Results

The security test runner generates a comprehensive report that includes:

- **Dependency Vulnerabilities**: Vulnerabilities in dependencies identified by Safety.
- **Code Vulnerabilities**: Security issues in the code identified by Bandit.
- **API Vulnerabilities**: Security issues in the API identified by custom security checks.

Review the report and address all identified vulnerabilities.

## Incident Response

### Incident Response Process

The Bulo.Cloud Sentinel platform follows a structured incident response process:

1. **Preparation**: Establish and maintain the capability to respond to security incidents effectively.
2. **Detection and Analysis**: Identify potential security incidents and determine their scope, impact, and root cause.
3. **Containment**: Limit the impact of the incident and prevent further damage.
4. **Eradication**: Remove the root cause of the incident and restore systems to a secure state.
5. **Recovery**: Restore systems and data to normal operation.
6. **Post-Incident Activities**: Learn from the incident and improve the incident response process.

### Reporting Security Incidents

If you discover a security incident, follow these steps:

1. **Report the incident**: Contact the Incident Response Coordinator (IRC) immediately.
2. **Provide details**: Provide as much information as possible about the incident, including:
   - Date and time of discovery
   - Systems and data affected
   - Description of the incident
   - Actions taken so far
3. **Follow instructions**: Follow the instructions provided by the IRC.
4. **Document everything**: Document all actions taken during the incident response process.

### Incident Response Roles and Responsibilities

The Incident Response Team (IRT) consists of the following roles:

- **Incident Response Coordinator (IRC)**: Oversees the incident response process and coordinates the activities of the team.
- **Security Analyst**: Investigates the incident and performs technical analysis.
- **System Administrator**: Assists with technical investigation and implements containment and recovery measures.
