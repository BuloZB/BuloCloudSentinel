# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The Bulo.Cloud Sentinel team takes security issues seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **Do not disclose the vulnerability publicly** until it has been addressed by the maintainers.
2. Email your findings to [security@bulocloud.com](mailto:security@bulocloud.com). If possible, encrypt your message with our PGP key.
3. Include the following information in your report:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Potential impact of the vulnerability
   - Any possible mitigations
   - Your name/handle for acknowledgment (optional)

## Security Update Process

When a security vulnerability is reported, the Bulo.Cloud Sentinel team will:

1. Confirm receipt of the vulnerability report within 48 hours
2. Assess the vulnerability and determine its severity
3. Develop and test a fix for the vulnerability
4. Release a security update
5. Publicly disclose the vulnerability after the fix has been released

## Supported Versions

Only the latest version of Bulo.Cloud Sentinel is actively supported with security updates. We recommend always using the most recent version.

## Security Best Practices

When deploying Bulo.Cloud Sentinel, we recommend the following security best practices:

1. **Keep dependencies up to date**: Regularly update all dependencies to their latest versions to benefit from security fixes.
2. **Use strong authentication**: Implement strong authentication mechanisms, including multi-factor authentication.
3. **Implement proper access controls**: Follow the principle of least privilege when configuring access controls.
4. **Secure communications**: Use TLS/SSL for all communications with proper certificate validation.
5. **Regular security audits**: Conduct regular security audits of your deployment.
6. **Monitor logs**: Regularly monitor logs for suspicious activity.
7. **Backup data**: Regularly backup your data and test restoration procedures.
8. **Environment configuration**: Use environment variables for sensitive configuration and never hardcode secrets.
9. **Container security**: If using containers, follow container security best practices (minimal base images, non-root users).
10. **Network security**: Implement proper network segmentation and firewall rules.
11. **Secure API endpoints**: Implement rate limiting, input validation, and proper authentication for all API endpoints.
12. **Content Security Policy**: Implement a strict Content Security Policy to prevent XSS attacks.
13. **Security headers**: Configure proper security headers for all HTTP responses.
14. **Vulnerability scanning**: Regularly scan your application for vulnerabilities using automated tools.
15. **Secure development practices**: Follow secure coding practices and conduct security-focused code reviews.

4. **Dependency Updates**: Updated vulnerable dependencies (python-jose, python-multipart, cryptography, pillow) to secure versions.
5. **Removed Hardcoded Credentials**: Eliminated hardcoded credentials and API keys from the codebase.
6. **Improved Error Handling**: Enhanced error handling to prevent information leakage.
7. **Input Validation**: Strengthened input validation across all API endpoints.
8. **Security Documentation**: Expanded security documentation with comprehensive guidelines and best practices.
9. **Token Revocation**: Implemented token revocation and blacklisting for secure logout.
10. **Content Security Policy**: Added Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to prevent XSS attacks.
11. **Advanced Rate Limiting**: Implemented advanced rate limiting for authentication endpoints.
12. **Secure File Uploads**: Added secure file upload validation with content type verification.
13. **Comprehensive Security Headers**: Implemented HSTS, X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, and other security headers.
14. **Enhanced Password Validation**: Added checks for common passwords and sequential characters.
15. **Centralized Security Configuration**: Created a centralized security configuration module.
