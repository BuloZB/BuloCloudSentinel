# 🚁 Drone Swarm System

The Drone Swarm System extends Bulo.Cloud Sentinel's capabilities with advanced multi-drone coordination and autonomous mission planning.

## 🚀 Features

- **🤖 Multi-Drone Coordination** - Coordinate multiple drones simultaneously for complex missions
- **🗺️ Autonomous Mission Planning** - Plan and execute autonomous missions with multiple waypoints
- **🔄 Swarm Intelligence** - Implement swarm behaviors for efficient area coverage and task distribution
- **⚠️ Collision Avoidance** - Advanced algorithms to prevent collisions between drones and obstacles
- **📡 Mesh Networking** - Resilient communication between drones even when some are out of direct range
- **🔋 Power Management** - Optimize missions based on battery levels and power consumption
- **🌦️ Weather Integration** - Adapt missions based on current and forecasted weather conditions
- **🚧 Geofencing** - Define no-fly zones and operational boundaries for safe operations
- **📊 Task Allocation** - Dynamically assign tasks to drones based on capabilities and position
- **🔄 Failover Mechanisms** - Automatic mission reassignment if a drone fails or needs to return to base

## 🏗️ Architecture

The Drone Swarm System is built as a microservice that integrates with the main Bulo.Cloud Sentinel platform:
