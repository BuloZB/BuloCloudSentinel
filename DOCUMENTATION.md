# Bulo.Cloud Sentinel Tactical Use Module Documentation

## Overview

This document provides detailed information about the newly integrated Tactical Use Module within Bulo.Cloud Sentinel. The module enhances the platform with advanced capabilities inspired by Anduril's Lattice Mesh system.

## Modules

### 1. Sensor Fusion Engine
- Ingests and processes data from diverse sensors such as cameras, radars, and LIDAR.
- Implements scalable data fusion algorithms to create a coherent operational picture.
- Provides real-time APIs for fused data retrieval.

### 2. Decentralized Mesh Networking
- Enables peer-to-peer communication among nodes using a mesh networking protocol.
- Ensures secure and resilient data transmission.
- Supports dynamic network topology adjustments.

### 3. Autonomous Mission Planning
- Tools for creating and managing autonomous missions for unmanned systems.
- AI algorithms for decision-making and adaptive mission execution.
- Simulation capabilities for mission rehearsal and validation.

### 4. Command and Control Interface
- User-friendly React dashboard for monitoring and controlling operations.
- Features real-time alerts, mission status updates, and system health indicators.
- Compatible with various devices and platforms.

### 5. Security and Access Control
- Robust authentication and authorization mechanisms using JWT and Keycloak.
- Data integrity and confidentiality across all communications.
- Audit logging of all mission planning and execution activities.

## Deployment

- Modular Dockerfiles and Kubernetes manifests are provided for all new services.
- Use `docker-compose.yml` for local development and testing.
- Helm charts are in preparation for production deployment.

## API Documentation

- OpenAPI documentation is available for all new endpoints.
- Refer to the `backend/api` directory for API implementations.

## User Guides and Tutorials

- User guides for mission planning, mesh networking, and sensor fusion are under development.
- Tutorials will be added to assist operators in utilizing the Tactical Use Module effectively.
