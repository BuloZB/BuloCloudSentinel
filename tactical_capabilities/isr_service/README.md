# ISR Service

The Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) service provides advanced capabilities for collecting, processing, and analyzing data from various sensors and sources to support tactical decision-making.

## Features

- Multi-sensor data fusion from drones, ground sensors, and other platforms
- Real-time target detection, tracking, and classification
- Automated area surveillance and monitoring
- Integration with existing Bulo.Cloud Sentinel components
- Secure API for accessing ISR data and capabilities
- Support for various sensor types (EO/IR cameras, radar, LiDAR, etc.)
- Persistent surveillance with historical data analysis

## Architecture

The ISR service is designed as a microservice that integrates with the Bulo.Cloud Sentinel platform. It provides a REST API for accessing ISR capabilities and publishes events to the message bus for real-time updates.

## Security

- JWT authentication and authorization
- Role-based access control
- Encrypted data storage and transmission
- Audit logging of all ISR operations
- Rate limiting for API endpoints

## Deployment

The service is containerized and can be deployed using Docker and Kubernetes.
